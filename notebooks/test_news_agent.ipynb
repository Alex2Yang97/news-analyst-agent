This week we’re looking at DeepSeek’s major boost in the U.S.; Elon Musk admitting he was wrong about FSD; teens losing trust in Big Tech; and more! Let’s do it. DeepSeek went viral this week after its AI models led Wall Street analysts and technologists to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race — and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. DeepSeek even claims that its R1 “reasoning” model performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. There’s a lot of moving parts surrounding DeepSeek, so we’ve put together everything you need to know right here.    Perplexity has been sued in federal court for allegedly violating another company’s trademark. Attorneys representing a company called Perplexity Solved Solutions accuse Perplexity of infringing on its trademark rights by using the brand “Perplexity.” The Texas company alleges that AI startup Perplexity began infringing on its trademark “in or around” August 2022 to promote its AI-powered search engine. Google is issuing a “voluntary exit program” for Android, Chrome, and Pixel employees this week, according to an internal memo sent by Google SVP Rick Osterloh. The voluntary severance program arrives less than a year after Google merged the separate teams into a single “Platform and Devices” division, overseen by Osterloh.

The organization surveyed over 1,000 teens on whether companies like Google, Apple, Meta, TikTok, and Microsoft cared about their well-being and safety, made ethical decisions, protected their private data, and more. In all cases, a majority of teens reported low levels of trust in these tech companies — and nearly half of teens said they had little or no trust that the companies would make responsible decisions about how they use AI.

Liang, 40, on Tuesday returned to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province, where a red banner was raised hailing the low-profile tech entrepreneur as \"hometown pride\" for bringing honour to the local community, according to social-media posts. His visit on Lunar New Year\\'s Eve marks the day when Chinese families traditionally hold reunions during this national public holiday. It also raised the profile of Liang\\'s hometown, which has turned into a tourist attraction based on its DeepSeek connection, amid an influx of domestic visitors to the remote village, according to a report by Yangcheng Evening News, a state-backed publication based in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong.

Hangzhou-based DeepSeek sent shock waves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley for developing AI models at a fraction of the cost and computing power that US tech firms like OpenAI, Google and Meta Platforms typically invest in such projects.    A red banner hung on a wall hails \"hometown pride\" Liang Wenfeng, founder and chief executive of DeepSeek, for bringing honour to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province. Photo: Weibo alt=A red banner hung on a wall hails \"hometown pride\" Liang Wenfeng, founder and chief executive of DeepSeek, for bringing honour to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province. Photo: Weibo> The heightened domestic and international attention given to DeepSeek and its founder reflects the AI community\\'s admiration for the firm\\'s low-cost development of world-class models - which either surpassed or matched the performance of rival products across a range of industry benchmark tests - in spite of tightened US restrictions on China\\'s access to advanced semiconductors and related technologies. An unidentified fellow Mililing villager was quoted by Yangcheng Evening News as saying that Liang was gifted growing up there, adding that \"he taught himself senior high-school maths when he was still a junior\".  Story Continues    During the 2002-2010 period when he studied in Zhejiang University, Liang developed an interest in applying machine-learning technology to quantitative trading. In 2015, Liang founded High-Flyer Quant, which uses deep-learning algorithms to run what has become one of the largest quantitative hedge funds in mainland China. In 2023, the company spun off DeepSeek as an independent enterprise. There are certain similarities between Liang and Jim Simons, the American quantitative hedge fund manager and mathematician, according to journalist Gregory Zuckerman, who wrote a book about the US billionaire titled The Man Who Solved the Market.    Liang apparently draws inspiration from Simons and agreed to write the preface of the book\\'s Chinese edition, Zuckerman reported in The Wall Street Journal. \"The publication of this book unravels many previously unresolved mysteries and brings us a wealth of experiences to learn from,\" Liang wrote in the preface. Liang also pointed out that whenever he encounters difficulties at work, he recalls Simons\\' words: \"There must be a way to model prices.\" This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

DeepSeek’s R1 model, which rivals top U.S. systems in performance, reportedly cost just $5.6 million to develop. The breakthrough sent shocks through global markets Monday, erasing nearly $1 trillion in U.S. and European tech stock value, including a record $589 billion drop in Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) market capitalization.    “It’s a paradigm shift,” Ali Ghodsi, CEO of Databricks Inc., said to Bloomberg. “These models that can reason are so much cheaper to produce that you will see it be democratized. You’ll see innovations from unexpected corners of the world.” Don\\'t Miss:  Nancy Pelosi Invested $5 Million In An AI Company Last Year — Here\\'s How You Can Invest In Multiple Pre-IPO AI Startups With Just $1,000  This 12,000 RPM Spinning Battery With Over $100 Million In LOIs Could Be The Missing Link For Green Energy — Here’s Why Early Investors Are Flocking To Invest Before Funding Closes   Meanwhile, OpenAI’s new o3 model, announced just before Christmas, signals a contrary trend—achieving breakthrough performance but at staggering costs. The model requires up to $3,000 to solve a single query that humans complete in seconds, using 172 times more computing power than previous approaches. “One very important thing to understand about the future: the economics of AI are about to change completely,” François Chollet, an AI researcher, said on X when o3 went public.    The model’s success came from its “test-time compute” approach, allowing it to think harder about each question. While this produced superior results, including a 91.5% score on Chollet’s challenging ARC test, it shattered previous cost assumptions about AI services. Trending: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100. OpenAI, valued at $157 billion, may charge up to $2,000 monthly for full access to o3, according to The Economist, which cited New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu. Even the company’s current “pro” version of o1 loses money on its $200 monthly subscription tier due to higher-than-expected usage. The cost structure challenges the traditional tech industry model of providing services at near-zero marginal cost. It also strengthens the position of suppliers like Nvidia and cloud providers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)), which control the essential computing infrastructure.DeepSeek’s success suggests an alternative path. Founded by Liang Wenfeng in 2023, the company achieved its results through efficiency innovations and reinforcement learning techniques, despite limited access to advanced U.S. chips.

You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. “More investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation,” Liang told Chinese media outlet 36kr. “Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation.” The development is catching Silicon Valley’s attention. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman noted the shift, calling DeepSeek’s R1 “an impressive model” and “invigorating.” Meta established an internal team to analyze DeepSeek’s methods, according to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter.    Instead of a winner-take-all market, experts predict an oligopoly where multiple firms compete based on specialized applications. Companies like Anthropic, valued at $60 billion, and xAI at $45 billion, suggest investors see room for multiple players despite the high costs.

These 2 \\'quiet\\' trades are \\'breaking with upside\\' instead.          William Edwards   Sat, Feb 1, 2025, 1:00 PM 3 min read                       Spencer Platt/Getty Images    US stock-market outperformance is due to end, says Bank of America\\'s Michael Hartnett.  Chinese AI firm DeepSeek challenges US tech-stock valuations, he said.  Plus, a US fiscal slowdown and lower immigration rates pose risks to market performance.   The days of the US stock market\\'s outperformance on a global stage are about to end, Bank of America\\'s top global strategist Michael Hartnett says.    \"US exceptionalism now exceptionally expensive, exceptionally well-owned, outperformance to peak in \\'25,\" Hartnett said in a client note on Friday. Hartnett laid out a three-point argument for why US stocks\\' outshining of the rest of the world may be over. One was the unexpected left hook that hit the US tech sector on Monday: DeepSeek. The Chinese AI firm released its R1 chatbot to much fanfare, as it seemingly rivals ChatGPT\\'s performance with a significantly lower production price tag and more efficient energy usage. Investors were suddenly left questioning if all the money that tech firms were throwing at AI infrastructure was going to generate the kind of profits they were betting on. Hartnett thinks the answer is no. \"DeepSeek means peak in AI capex return expectations,\" he wrote. The other reasons Hartnett is skeptical that US stocks can continue to beat their global counterparts are the slowdown in government spending he expects and lower immigration levels. US fiscal spending has been well above trend over the last five years, which has helped propel the market\\'s outperformance, Hartnett argued. But since taking office on January 20, President Trump has tried to issue a government spending halt.   Bank of America   The number of immigrants entering the US at the southern border has also sharply dropped in the last few months. Hartnett highlighted that of the US population\\'s 3.3 million gain in 2024, 2.7 million (84%) were immigrants. And according to a Cato Institute analysis of Census Bureau data, 78% of job gains from 2019 to March 2024 were by immigrants. Lower immigration rates could slow job growth and hamper the economic expansion.   Bank of America   These trends don\\'t necessarily mean the broader market is set to crash, Hartnett said. Rather, the so-called Magnificent Seven is probably set to underperform, and other parts of the market could benefit. The biggest risks facing the market are inflation and where 10-year Treasury rates go, he said. Tariffs could prove trouble for inflation and rates and, in turn, stocks. On Friday, major US stock indexes dropped after the White House announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and 10% tariffs on China. The S&P 500 fell more than 1% in the last few hours of trading, while 10-year yields climbed as much as eight basis points, from 4.5% to 4.58%.  Story Continues    2 trades outside the US Two \"quiet\" opportunities in global markets right now, meanwhile, are bank stocks in both Japan and Europe, according to Hartnett. \"Investors all-in on US exceptionalism, missing new secular bulls in cheap, unloved Japan & Europe banks,\" the notoriously short-winded Hartnett wrote. \"Note Japan banks still 74% below 1980s highs (Chart 4), EU banks 67% below 2007 highs (Chart 5), and both breaking with upside likely in our view.\" Below are the charts Hartnett is referring to.   Bank of America   Two ways to gain exposure to these trades are through exchange-traded funds like the iShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF (EUFN) and the iShares MSCI Japan Value ETF (EWJV), which has a 26% weighting to Japanese financials sector stocks.

The kicker here is that DeepSeek reportedly accomplished this using significantly less computational power, relying on fewer and less advanced AI chips -- particularly Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) cutting-edge GPUs, which are typically considered essential for such tasks.

Dan Victor, The Motley Fool   Sat, Feb 1, 2025, 4:12 AM 5 min read                   In This Article:    NVDA       DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, is sending shock waves through the U.S. tech sector by demonstrating its latest AI assistant, which achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing some of the world\\'s best chatbots. The kicker here is that DeepSeek reportedly accomplished this using significantly less computational power, relying on fewer and less advanced AI chips -- particularly Nvidia\\'s (NASDAQ: NVDA) cutting-edge GPUs, which are typically considered essential for such tasks.    This development suggests a potentially disruptive method for developing large language models (LLMs), offering a more efficient alternative to current strategies. It raises questions about future infrastructure investments and the demand for AI chips. The market\\'s reaction has been swift: As of this wriging, Nvidia\\'s stock has plunged more than 22% from its recent peak, with similar declines in other leading AI tech stocks. Let\\'s explore what DeepSeek\\'s emergence could mean for Nvidia and how it might affect investors\\' portfolios. The innovation behind DeepSeek\\'s success Artificial intelligence is not only a major theme in technology but also a national security issue, given its pivotal role in areas like data analysis, intelligence, and military applications. This has led the United States to impose bans or severe restrictions on exporting high-end technologies, such as specialized AI semiconductors, to China since 2023, aiming to slow the country\\'s technological progress and safeguard crucial supply chains. Despite these constraints, DeepSeek managed to develop AI models like DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 with cutting-edge capabilities on a reported training budget of around $6 million. Its white paper outlines an innovative approach that combines software ingenuity with new training techniques to maximize the potential of older Nvidia GPUs, surpassing their initial capabilities.    DeepSeek\\'s models have shown impressive results next to market-leading alternatives from OpenAI, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms in benchmarks for problem-solving, mathematical reasoning, coding, and general knowledge. The DeepSeek AI Assistant rapidly ascended to become the most-downloaded free application on the Apple App Store in the United States, demonstrating significant market traction and consumer acceptance. DeepSeek\\'s disruptive influence is further underscored by its open-source platform, which makes the code publicly accessible, allowing businesses and developers to customize AI models without incurring the high costs of proprietary systems. For those seeking to integrate DeepSeek\\'s most advanced models into existing tech infrastructure via an application programming interface (api), the company reportedly offers commercial pricing that is significantly lower than that of its competitors.  Story Continues      Image source: Getty Images.   Implications for Nvidia DeepSeek\\'s emergence has multiple implications for the broader tech sector. Given the initial sell-off, the market has interpreted this development as decisively negative, likely based on a concern that novel AI development methods could reduce the demand for cutting-edge, expensive hardware and cut into the competitive moat of established leaders. That being said, the impact on Nvidia may be more nuanced as it looks like the next-generation AI chips, including Nvidia\\'s Blackwell GPU architecture, are essential for pushing the boundaries of high-performance computing.    If DeepSeek managed to break AI performance benchmarks with legacy hardware, its methods toward computational efficiency implemented by other tech players could make Nvidia\\'s high-end products incrementally even more powerful. This scenario could help expand the AI market by opening up new uses that may become cost-effective while accelerating the timetable toward future breakthroughs like artificial general intelligence (AGI) applications as a demand driver for Nvidia. On the other hand, it is also clear that DeepSeek has introduced a new layer of complexity regarding Nvidia\\'s growth runway. According to Wall Street analysts monitored by Yahoo! Finance, the chipmaker is expected to reach $197 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026, which ends in January 2026, driving a 51% increase in earnings per share (EPS) to $4.45. Any sign that customers are pivoting away from large orders, even at the margin, would undermine this earnings outlook and further pressure the stock. The company\\'s upcoming fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report, set to be released on Feb. 26, will provide Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and hist eam a chance to address whether DeepSeek is affecting the business and reassure shareholders.  Metric  FY 2025 Analyst Estimate  FY 2026 Analyst Estimate   Revenue  $129.2 billion  $196.5 billion   Revenue growth (YOY)  112%  52%   EPS  $2.95  $4.45   EPS growth (YOY)  127%  51%    Data source: Yahoo! Finance. FY = fiscal year. YOY = year over year. The big picture for investors DeepSeek appears to have signaled a new shift toward efficiency in AI software, highlighting the rapidly changing landscape. Recognizing near-term uncertainties with an expectation for volatility to continue, I believe investors should stay the course with Nvidia as an AI leader with a technological edge in hardware. Unless there is evidence that its financials are under pressure, a positive long-term outlook should support the stock, which remains well positioned to rebound.

Sat, Feb 1, 2025, 11:03 PM 5 min read                     Feb. 1—Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang disrupted stock markets earlier this month when he suggested useful quantum computers were at least two decades away. Rajeeb Hazra, the head of what is likely the leading full-stack quantum computing company, Quantinuum, suggests otherwise. \"It\\'s in the next three to five years that you will see tremendous gains,\" Hazra told the Journal in an interview last month.    Hazra\\'s company is making a big bet on rapidly deploying quantum computing into everyday use, and it\\'s looking to draw on New Mexico\\'s quantum ecosystem. Having already established partnerships with entities like Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the University of New Mexico, Quantinuum is bringing a research and development facility to the state by the end of this year — positioning New Mexico firmly at the front of the current quantum revolution. While Hazra declined to comment on where that facility would be located, saying the company is in the \"land and capital planning\" and \"workforce planning\" stages, Quantinuum plans to support ongoing efforts to advance its integrated photonics and optics capabilities. That\\'s a critical component for quantum computing, Hazra said, because \"quantum computing is all about things and manipulating those things.\" \"Those things are called qubits (quantum bits), and manipulating them, which means moving them, reading them, setting values to them so that you can compute,\" Hazra said. \"Optics is a fundamental capability of the computation to manipulate, touch, read these qubits. ... Integrated means you\\'re getting more scale. You\\'re miniaturizing them so you can have larger, more powerful quantum computers in the future.\"    In choosing New Mexico for its next facility — Quantinuum has a presence in Colorado, Minnesota, Washington, D.C., the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan — the company sees a partner and a workforce capable of bringing online the next generation of quantum computing. Hazra and state officials have been discussing economic development incentives though nothing has been finalized as of yet. The company plans to make a \"sizable investment\" in its expansion into New Mexico, Hazra said. Michael Coleman, a spokesperson for the governor, wrote to the Journal in an email this month that the New Mexico Economic Development Department is working with the company on an incentive package \"that will be announced in the coming months.\" Coleman didn\\'t specify which types of funding Quantinuum could receive.  Story Continues    But the state has valuable funding, like the Local Economic Development Act and the new Quantum Technologies Award Pilot Program launched in December — specifically aimed at supporting the growth and relocation of quantum computing companies. \"No doubt, this is a big win for our state. Quantinuum is the world\\'s largest quantum company with the most advanced quantum software and top developers and engineers,\" Coleman added. \"The fact the company chose New Mexico for expansion is testament to the governor\\'s vision for this industry, and our continued support for technology and innovation at our universities and research centers.\"    Quantum computing can have many applications, from aiding in the discovery of new medicines and creating targeted prescriptions to logistics for manufacturing. \"Quantum computing is going to be embedded in the fiber of almost every use case, as you work, play and communicate with people,\" Hazra said. The Quantinuum expansion is the latest addition to a bustling quantum ecosystem in New Mexico. Because of the labs\\' and UNM\\'s long history in quantum research, the state was at the forefront of the \"second quantum revolution,\" which began sometime in the 1990s, according to Ivan Deutsch, a UNM professor who also leads the Quantum New Mexico Institute. \"That basic R&D (done here) has kind of helped create the foundation of this new technological revolution,\" Deutsch said. Last year, the federal Economic Development Association identified New Mexico and Colorado as one of a dozen tech hubs in the U.S. — a designation that awarded the two states $41 million to focus on quantum information technology. UNM and New Mexico State University researchers in August were awarded a $1 million grant from the National Science Foundation to research the development of a photonic quantum computer operating at room temperature. The New Mexico Quantum Moonshot — a partnership between the labs, universities and the private sector — was selected as a finalist in the National Science Foundation\\'s Regional Innovation Engines program, which could bring hundreds of millions of dollars to the state.    Officials have said the hub designation funding, for instance, could create 10,000 jobs, allowing the training of up to 30,000 workers. \"Quantum computing is an end-to-end capability. You have to have the technological capability, but then you have to have the partners who use that capability, and most importantly, the generations of workforce that\\'s going to continue to build out that capability,\" Hazra said. \"And New Mexico is uniquely placed with a combination of what it already has in the ecosystem and its workforce development.\" Deutsch said a group of large tech companies is developing quantum computers, like IBM and Google. But Quantinuum, which not only develops the hardware but also the software for quantum computing, has \"the highest quality quantum computer on the market today,\" Deutsch said. \"This expansion is going to turn a lot of heads,\" Deutsch said. \"I think that this is going to be a snowball effect. It\\'ll be the first (company to come here), but it\\'s not going to be the last. ... It\\'s a huge deal.\" Matthew Narvaiz covers the economy for the Albuquerque Journal.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and other AI stocks plunged on Monday, Jan. 27, as investors responded to the threat from DeepSeek, the Chinese AI chatbot that rivals top models like ChatGPT for a fraction of the cost.    Nvidia lost 17% in one session, wiping out $600 billion in market value, the biggest one-day loss for a single stock in market history. Since then, Nvidia has recouped some of those losses, a sign investors may believe the sell-off may have been an overreaction. Nonetheless, AI stocks remain significantly lower, and Nvidia itself tipped its hat to the Chinese start-up, with a spokesperson calling it \"an excellent AI advancement.\" DeepSeek also seems to be gaining credibility, as Microsoft, which is believed to be OpenAI\\'s biggest investor, has already added the model to its Azure cloud infrastructure service. So how big of a threat is DeepSeek to the AI ecosystem? To answer that question, let\\'s outline a few facts about DeepSeek first.   Image source: Nvidia.   What we know about DeepSeek DeepSeek is a Chinese AI start-up founded by hedge fund chief Liang Wenfeng in May 2023. Unlike OpenAI\\'s ChatGPT or Alphabet\\'s Gemini, DeepSeek uses an open-source large language model, meaning developers can update it and adapt it to their own needs. DeepSeek is significant because its R1 model rivals OpenAI\\'s o1 in categories like math, code, and reasoning tasks, and it purportedly does that with less advanced chips and at a much lower cost. According to one estimate, it costs OpenAI\\'s o1 model $60 to generate a million tokens of output, while DeepSeek\\'s R1 can deliver the same quantity for just $2.19.    DeepSeek has impressed industry insiders with a 22-page research paper explaining how its model works, but the company has also been accused by OpenAI of using a method called distillation to build its models, a cost-efficient way of training an AI model using larger, more adept ones. Doing so constitutes a violation of OpenAI\\'s terms of service. Distillation is commonly used in AI, but if that accusation is true, it would seem to undermine a lot of DeepSeek\\'s credibility, making it seem like the Chinese start-up plagiarized at least part of its model. There\\'s also a debate over how much DeepSeek actually paid for its infrastructure, as it said it cost just $5.6 million to train its V3 model. The V3 was built on Nvidia H800s, which were made to get around U.S. export rules and perform similarly to H100s, Nvidia\\'s GPUs that have been widely used to build AI infrastructure and models in the U.S.  Story Continues    Analysts have cast doubt on the $5.6 million figure, and that doesn\\'t seem to include essential costs like research, architecture, or data, making it difficult to do a direct comparison with U.S-based AI models that have required billions of dollars in investments. What it means for Nvidia It\\'s too early to know what the implications of DeepSeek are for Nvidia and the broader AI sector, and there\\'s still a lot of uncertainty around what exactly DeepSeek has achieved. The company appears to have made genuine gains in efficiency, but those seem less impressive if its model was built in part by borrowing from OpenAI. The true cost of the model also isn\\'t fully clear. The DeepSeek-R1 launch was called a \"Sputnik moment\" by Silicon Valley honcho Marc Andreessen and others, and the geopolitical implications of the new chatbot could be just as meaningful as the technological ones.    The U.S. could respond by intensifying the tech cold war with China, tightening export rules further and taking other measures. Additionally, allowing DeepSeek on U.S. smartphones while banning TikTok seems incongruous, and U.S. corporations and governments are likely to be skeptical of handing their data over to a Chinese start-up. For Nvidia investors, it\\'s also worth remembering that this is just one episode in a years-long technology evolution, and is probably not as meaningful as a $600 billion one-day sell-off makes it seem. Even if DeepSeek shifts the entire industry to a more efficient open-source architecture, that could be a positive for Nvidia over the long run. According to Jevons paradox, lowering the price to run AI models could increase demand, leading to an increase in total consumption, which would drive more purchases of AI chips from Nvidia, though likely at a lower cost. It\\'s also meaningful that DeepSeek was built on Nvidia chips. No one\\'s challenging its supremacy there. Why I\\'m not worried about Nvidia Investors shouldn\\'t miss the forest for the trees here. You should remember that a competent AI chatbot isn\\'t the goal here. The ultimate goal is artificial general intelligence, including applications like autonomous vehicles and robotics, and it\\'s unclear if DeepSeek dramatically changes the calculus around that. Those technologies are powerful and valuable enough that the race toward AGI will continue, and the tech giants competing in it will continue to pour billions into the infrastructure necessary to build it. Efficiency is important, but technological leadership is the real prize here.    Nvidia stock was already dealt a setback by DeepSeek, and that could be true of Nvidia\\'s business as well, but the company has proven itself to be nimble before. It\\'s evolved its technology to go from primarily serving video games to cryptocurrency mining, AI, autonomous vehicles, 3D rendering, and more. CEO Jensen Huang is rightly regarded as a visionary in the industry, and it continues to rapidly innovate with its new Rubin platform in development. The AI frontier will continue to evolve, and Nvidia will adapt to market conditions as needed. Whatever the impact of DeepSeek, the race to AGI isn\\'t going away, and neither is Nvidia.

Headlines from the US Stock Market Uncertainty sweeps across the US with the incoming administration’s potential policies. Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve has decided to pause its rate-cutting cycle and the decision to resume easing is doubtful amidst Trump\\'s trade policies which are being deemed inflationary. Tariffs on foreign imports are considered a risk of reviving inflation. According to Reuters, Dustin Reid, chief strategist of fixed income at Mackenzie Investments in Toronto, reiterated the uncertainty looming as follows: \"Everything that is going on right now, from economic data to markets news and tariffs, adds up to a lot more uncertainty across all markets\"  Recently, technology stocks benefitting from the business potential of AI witnessed a deep shock as Chinese startup DeepSeek revealed a large language model that can compete with American AI giants but at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s, Google’s, or Meta’s popular AI models. DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it claims took only two months and less than $6 to build.    The event raised a lot of concerns over America’s leadership in the AI sector and how big tech giants are investing heavily in AI models and data centers while DeepSeek somehow developed a highly competitive model without having as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers,\\xa0as pointed out by Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James. While the US has been trying to limit China’s access to the chips powering advanced AI systems, the news about DeepSeek’s chatbot making it to most-downloaded free app in the US on Apple’s App Store demonstrates the country’s rapid gains in the sector. Our Methodology In order to compile a list of the 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds, we used a consensus of similar rankings as well as blue-chip ETFs. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points\\xa0(see more details here).  Story Continues      NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA): Revolutionizing AI and High-Performance Computing   A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193 NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in products and platforms for the gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive markets. The chip maker is a pioneer of GPU-accelerated computing and is well known for its GPU technology. As of 2024’s third quarter, the company had 90% of the global GPU market share. Based on the rising interest in AI and a strong demand for its AI-centric chips across various industries, NVIDIA ended up being the largest global gainer in market capitalization for 2024. Among the most valuable global stocks, the chip maker witnessed its market value increasing by more than $2 trillion last year and hitting $3.28 trillion at the close of 2024.    Although NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the major beneficiaries of the AI boom in tech stocks, the company lost nearly $600 billion in market value as the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek shook the industry, referred to as the largest market value drop in U.S. stock market history. The loss resulted in Apple retaking the position of the world’s most valuable company. Reuters reported that NVDA thinks DeepSeek\\'s advances point to a need for more of its chips to cater to the demand for DeepSeek\\'s services in the future and the usefulness of NVDA chips for the Chinese market. Overall NVDA ranks 4th on our list of the best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Shares have lost over 12% this week after the emergence of a sophisticated, lower-cost AI model from Chinese startup DeepSeek spurred a reckoning\\xa0on Wall Street about AI spending.  Analysts have largely remained bullish on the chipmaker\\'s stock, suggesting the market\\'s reaction may have been overblown.       Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang is set to meet with President Donald Trump at the White House, Bloomberg reported Friday, after a wild week for the chipmaker\\'s stock. Shares wavered between gains and losses near $125 in afternoon trading Friday, having lost more than 12% of their value this week after the rapid rise of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled markets. The surging popularity of an app from DeepSeek, which claimed it developed an AI model rivaling the performance of American competitors for a fraction of the cost, spurred a reckoning on Wall Street about the competitiveness of American AI leaders and their spending on tech, sending shares of Nvidia and other AI stocks into a tailspin earlier in the week. Still, analysts have largely remained bullish on the chipmaker\\'s stock, with Bank of America telling clients Wednesday they \"view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity.\" Analysts at Bernstein, Citi, Wedbush, Raymond James, and elsewhere were also among those that suggested the market’s reaction may have been overblown.    Raymond James and Bank of America added that they expect competition from China could push Big Tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL) to spend even more on AI, to the benefit of Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO), and other AI chipmakers. In earnings calls this week, executives from Microsoft and Meta stood by their plans to spend billions of dollars this year on AI infrastructure. Huang\\'s meeting at the White House also comes following reports the Trump administration could be considering further tightening restrictions on sales of advanced U.S. chips to China. Nvidia reported in November that sales to China accounted for more than 15% of the chipmaker\\'s revenues in its fiscal third quarter. Nvidia is set to report its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26.

This week we’re looking at DeepSeek’s major boost in the U.S.; Elon Musk admitting he was wrong about FSD; teens losing trust in Big Tech; and more! Let’s do it. DeepSeek went viral this week after its AI models led Wall Street analysts and technologists to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race — and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. DeepSeek even claims that its R1 “reasoning” model performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. There’s a lot of moving parts surrounding DeepSeek, so we’ve put together everything you need to know right here.    Perplexity has been sued in federal court for allegedly violating another company’s trademark. Attorneys representing a company called Perplexity Solved Solutions accuse Perplexity of infringing on its trademark rights by using the brand “Perplexity.” The Texas company alleges that AI startup Perplexity began infringing on its trademark “in or around” August 2022 to promote its AI-powered search engine. Google is issuing a “voluntary exit program” for Android, Chrome, and Pixel employees this week, according to an internal memo sent by Google SVP Rick Osterloh. The voluntary severance program arrives less than a year after Google merged the separate teams into a single “Platform and Devices” division, overseen by Osterloh.

The organization surveyed over 1,000 teens on whether companies like Google, Apple, Meta, TikTok, and Microsoft cared about their well-being and safety, made ethical decisions, protected their private data, and more. In all cases, a majority of teens reported low levels of trust in these tech companies — and nearly half of teens said they had little or no trust that the companies would make responsible decisions about how they use AI.

Liang, 40, on Tuesday returned to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province, where a red banner was raised hailing the low-profile tech entrepreneur as \"hometown pride\" for bringing honour to the local community, according to social-media posts. His visit on Lunar New Year\\'s Eve marks the day when Chinese families traditionally hold reunions during this national public holiday. It also raised the profile of Liang\\'s hometown, which has turned into a tourist attraction based on its DeepSeek connection, amid an influx of domestic visitors to the remote village, according to a report by Yangcheng Evening News, a state-backed publication based in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong.

Hangzhou-based DeepSeek sent shock waves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley for developing AI models at a fraction of the cost and computing power that US tech firms like OpenAI, Google and Meta Platforms typically invest in such projects.    A red banner hung on a wall hails \"hometown pride\" Liang Wenfeng, founder and chief executive of DeepSeek, for bringing honour to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province. Photo: Weibo alt=A red banner hung on a wall hails \"hometown pride\" Liang Wenfeng, founder and chief executive of DeepSeek, for bringing honour to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province. Photo: Weibo> The heightened domestic and international attention given to DeepSeek and its founder reflects the AI community\\'s admiration for the firm\\'s low-cost development of world-class models - which either surpassed or matched the performance of rival products across a range of industry benchmark tests - in spite of tightened US restrictions on China\\'s access to advanced semiconductors and related technologies. An unidentified fellow Mililing villager was quoted by Yangcheng Evening News as saying that Liang was gifted growing up there, adding that \"he taught himself senior high-school maths when he was still a junior\".  Story Continues    During the 2002-2010 period when he studied in Zhejiang University, Liang developed an interest in applying machine-learning technology to quantitative trading. In 2015, Liang founded High-Flyer Quant, which uses deep-learning algorithms to run what has become one of the largest quantitative hedge funds in mainland China. In 2023, the company spun off DeepSeek as an independent enterprise. There are certain similarities between Liang and Jim Simons, the American quantitative hedge fund manager and mathematician, according to journalist Gregory Zuckerman, who wrote a book about the US billionaire titled The Man Who Solved the Market.    Liang apparently draws inspiration from Simons and agreed to write the preface of the book\\'s Chinese edition, Zuckerman reported in The Wall Street Journal. \"The publication of this book unravels many previously unresolved mysteries and brings us a wealth of experiences to learn from,\" Liang wrote in the preface. Liang also pointed out that whenever he encounters difficulties at work, he recalls Simons\\' words: \"There must be a way to model prices.\" This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

DeepSeek’s R1 model, which rivals top U.S. systems in performance, reportedly cost just $5.6 million to develop. The breakthrough sent shocks through global markets Monday, erasing nearly $1 trillion in U.S. and European tech stock value, including a record $589 billion drop in Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) market capitalization.    “It’s a paradigm shift,” Ali Ghodsi, CEO of Databricks Inc., said to Bloomberg. “These models that can reason are so much cheaper to produce that you will see it be democratized. You’ll see innovations from unexpected corners of the world.” Don\\'t Miss:  Nancy Pelosi Invested $5 Million In An AI Company Last Year — Here\\'s How You Can Invest In Multiple Pre-IPO AI Startups With Just $1,000  This 12,000 RPM Spinning Battery With Over $100 Million In LOIs Could Be The Missing Link For Green Energy — Here’s Why Early Investors Are Flocking To Invest Before Funding Closes   Meanwhile, OpenAI’s new o3 model, announced just before Christmas, signals a contrary trend—achieving breakthrough performance but at staggering costs. The model requires up to $3,000 to solve a single query that humans complete in seconds, using 172 times more computing power than previous approaches. “One very important thing to understand about the future: the economics of AI are about to change completely,” François Chollet, an AI researcher, said on X when o3 went public.    The model’s success came from its “test-time compute” approach, allowing it to think harder about each question. While this produced superior results, including a 91.5% score on Chollet’s challenging ARC test, it shattered previous cost assumptions about AI services. Trending: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100. OpenAI, valued at $157 billion, may charge up to $2,000 monthly for full access to o3, according to The Economist, which cited New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu. Even the company’s current “pro” version of o1 loses money on its $200 monthly subscription tier due to higher-than-expected usage. The cost structure challenges the traditional tech industry model of providing services at near-zero marginal cost. It also strengthens the position of suppliers like Nvidia and cloud providers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)), which control the essential computing infrastructure.DeepSeek’s success suggests an alternative path. Founded by Liang Wenfeng in 2023, the company achieved its results through efficiency innovations and reinforcement learning techniques, despite limited access to advanced U.S. chips.

You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. “More investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation,” Liang told Chinese media outlet 36kr. “Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation.” The development is catching Silicon Valley’s attention. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman noted the shift, calling DeepSeek’s R1 “an impressive model” and “invigorating.” Meta established an internal team to analyze DeepSeek’s methods, according to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter.    Instead of a winner-take-all market, experts predict an oligopoly where multiple firms compete based on specialized applications. Companies like Anthropic, valued at $60 billion, and xAI at $45 billion, suggest investors see room for multiple players despite the high costs.

These 2 \\'quiet\\' trades are \\'breaking with upside\\' instead.          William Edwards   Sat, Feb 1, 2025, 1:00 PM 3 min read                       Spencer Platt/Getty Images    US stock-market outperformance is due to end, says Bank of America\\'s Michael Hartnett.  Chinese AI firm DeepSeek challenges US tech-stock valuations, he said.  Plus, a US fiscal slowdown and lower immigration rates pose risks to market performance.   The days of the US stock market\\'s outperformance on a global stage are about to end, Bank of America\\'s top global strategist Michael Hartnett says.    \"US exceptionalism now exceptionally expensive, exceptionally well-owned, outperformance to peak in \\'25,\" Hartnett said in a client note on Friday. Hartnett laid out a three-point argument for why US stocks\\' outshining of the rest of the world may be over. One was the unexpected left hook that hit the US tech sector on Monday: DeepSeek. The Chinese AI firm released its R1 chatbot to much fanfare, as it seemingly rivals ChatGPT\\'s performance with a significantly lower production price tag and more efficient energy usage. Investors were suddenly left questioning if all the money that tech firms were throwing at AI infrastructure was going to generate the kind of profits they were betting on. Hartnett thinks the answer is no. \"DeepSeek means peak in AI capex return expectations,\" he wrote. The other reasons Hartnett is skeptical that US stocks can continue to beat their global counterparts are the slowdown in government spending he expects and lower immigration levels. US fiscal spending has been well above trend over the last five years, which has helped propel the market\\'s outperformance, Hartnett argued. But since taking office on January 20, President Trump has tried to issue a government spending halt.   Bank of America   The number of immigrants entering the US at the southern border has also sharply dropped in the last few months. Hartnett highlighted that of the US population\\'s 3.3 million gain in 2024, 2.7 million (84%) were immigrants. And according to a Cato Institute analysis of Census Bureau data, 78% of job gains from 2019 to March 2024 were by immigrants. Lower immigration rates could slow job growth and hamper the economic expansion.   Bank of America   These trends don\\'t necessarily mean the broader market is set to crash, Hartnett said. Rather, the so-called Magnificent Seven is probably set to underperform, and other parts of the market could benefit. The biggest risks facing the market are inflation and where 10-year Treasury rates go, he said. Tariffs could prove trouble for inflation and rates and, in turn, stocks. On Friday, major US stock indexes dropped after the White House announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and 10% tariffs on China. The S&P 500 fell more than 1% in the last few hours of trading, while 10-year yields climbed as much as eight basis points, from 4.5% to 4.58%.  Story Continues    2 trades outside the US Two \"quiet\" opportunities in global markets right now, meanwhile, are bank stocks in both Japan and Europe, according to Hartnett. \"Investors all-in on US exceptionalism, missing new secular bulls in cheap, unloved Japan & Europe banks,\" the notoriously short-winded Hartnett wrote. \"Note Japan banks still 74% below 1980s highs (Chart 4), EU banks 67% below 2007 highs (Chart 5), and both breaking with upside likely in our view.\" Below are the charts Hartnett is referring to.   Bank of America   Two ways to gain exposure to these trades are through exchange-traded funds like the iShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF (EUFN) and the iShares MSCI Japan Value ETF (EWJV), which has a 26% weighting to Japanese financials sector stocks.

Dan Victor, The Motley Fool   Sat, Feb 1, 2025, 4:12 AM 5 min read                   In This Article:    NVDA       DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, is sending shock waves through the U.S. tech sector by demonstrating its latest AI assistant, which achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing some of the world\\'s best chatbots. The kicker here is that DeepSeek reportedly accomplished this using significantly less computational power, relying on fewer and less advanced AI chips -- particularly Nvidia\\'s (NASDAQ: NVDA) cutting-edge GPUs, which are typically considered essential for such tasks.    This development suggests a potentially disruptive method for developing large language models (LLMs), offering a more efficient alternative to current strategies. It raises questions about future infrastructure investments and the demand for AI chips. The market\\'s reaction has been swift: As of this wriging, Nvidia\\'s stock has plunged more than 22% from its recent peak, with similar declines in other leading AI tech stocks. Let\\'s explore what DeepSeek\\'s emergence could mean for Nvidia and how it might affect investors\\' portfolios. The innovation behind DeepSeek\\'s success Artificial intelligence is not only a major theme in technology but also a national security issue, given its pivotal role in areas like data analysis, intelligence, and military applications. This has led the United States to impose bans or severe restrictions on exporting high-end technologies, such as specialized AI semiconductors, to China since 2023, aiming to slow the country\\'s technological progress and safeguard crucial supply chains. Despite these constraints, DeepSeek managed to develop AI models like DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 with cutting-edge capabilities on a reported training budget of around $6 million. Its white paper outlines an innovative approach that combines software ingenuity with new training techniques to maximize the potential of older Nvidia GPUs, surpassing their initial capabilities.    DeepSeek\\'s models have shown impressive results next to market-leading alternatives from OpenAI, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms in benchmarks for problem-solving, mathematical reasoning, coding, and general knowledge. The DeepSeek AI Assistant rapidly ascended to become the most-downloaded free application on the Apple App Store in the United States, demonstrating significant market traction and consumer acceptance. DeepSeek\\'s disruptive influence is further underscored by its open-source platform, which makes the code publicly accessible, allowing businesses and developers to customize AI models without incurring the high costs of proprietary systems. For those seeking to integrate DeepSeek\\'s most advanced models into existing tech infrastructure via an application programming interface (api), the company reportedly offers commercial pricing that is significantly lower than that of its competitors.  Story Continues      Image source: Getty Images.   Implications for Nvidia DeepSeek\\'s emergence has multiple implications for the broader tech sector. Given the initial sell-off, the market has interpreted this development as decisively negative, likely based on a concern that novel AI development methods could reduce the demand for cutting-edge, expensive hardware and cut into the competitive moat of established leaders. That being said, the impact on Nvidia may be more nuanced as it looks like the next-generation AI chips, including Nvidia\\'s Blackwell GPU architecture, are essential for pushing the boundaries of high-performance computing.    If DeepSeek managed to break AI performance benchmarks with legacy hardware, its methods toward computational efficiency implemented by other tech players could make Nvidia\\'s high-end products incrementally even more powerful. This scenario could help expand the AI market by opening up new uses that may become cost-effective while accelerating the timetable toward future breakthroughs like artificial general intelligence (AGI) applications as a demand driver for Nvidia. On the other hand, it is also clear that DeepSeek has introduced a new layer of complexity regarding Nvidia\\'s growth runway. According to Wall Street analysts monitored by Yahoo! Finance, the chipmaker is expected to reach $197 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026, which ends in January 2026, driving a 51% increase in earnings per share (EPS) to $4.45. Any sign that customers are pivoting away from large orders, even at the margin, would undermine this earnings outlook and further pressure the stock. The company\\'s upcoming fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report, set to be released on Feb. 26, will provide Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and hist eam a chance to address whether DeepSeek is affecting the business and reassure shareholders.  Metric  FY 2025 Analyst Estimate  FY 2026 Analyst Estimate   Revenue  $129.2 billion  $196.5 billion   Revenue growth (YOY)  112%  52%   EPS  $2.95  $4.45   EPS growth (YOY)  127%  51%    Data source: Yahoo! Finance. FY = fiscal year. YOY = year over year. The big picture for investors DeepSeek appears to have signaled a new shift toward efficiency in AI software, highlighting the rapidly changing landscape. Recognizing near-term uncertainties with an expectation for volatility to continue, I believe investors should stay the course with Nvidia as an AI leader with a technological edge in hardware. Unless there is evidence that its financials are under pressure, a positive long-term outlook should support the stock, which remains well positioned to rebound.

DeepSeek went viral this week after its AI models led Wall Street analysts and technologists to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race — and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain. DeepSeek even claims that its R1 “reasoning” model performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks. There’s a lot of moving parts surrounding DeepSeek, so we’ve put together everything you need to know right here.    Perplexity has been sued in federal court for allegedly violating another company’s trademark. Attorneys representing a company called Perplexity Solved Solutions accuse Perplexity of infringing on its trademark rights by using the brand “Perplexity.” The Texas company alleges that AI startup Perplexity began infringing on its trademark “in or around” August 2022 to promote its AI-powered search engine. Google is issuing a “voluntary exit program” for Android, Chrome, and Pixel employees this week, according to an internal memo sent by Google SVP Rick Osterloh. The voluntary severance program arrives less than a year after Google merged the separate teams into a single “Platform and Devices” division, overseen by Osterloh.

Read more Analysis   Image Credits:Daniel de la Hoz (opens in a new window) / Getty Images   Teens don’t trust Big Tech: American teens have lost their faith in Big Tech, according to a new report from Common Sense Media. The organization surveyed over 1,000 teens on whether companies like Google, Apple, Meta, TikTok, and Microsoft cared about their well-being and safety, made ethical decisions, protected their private data, and more. In all cases, a majority of teens reported low levels of trust in these tech companies — and nearly half of teens said they had little or no trust that the companies would make responsible decisions about how they use AI.

Liang, 40, on Tuesday returned to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province, where a red banner was raised hailing the low-profile tech entrepreneur as \"hometown pride\" for bringing honour to the local community, according to social-media posts. His visit on Lunar New Year\\'s Eve marks the day when Chinese families traditionally hold reunions during this national public holiday. It also raised the profile of Liang\\'s hometown, which has turned into a tourist attraction based on its DeepSeek connection, amid an influx of domestic visitors to the remote village, according to a report by Yangcheng Evening News, a state-backed publication based in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong.

Hangzhou-based DeepSeek sent shock waves through Wall Street and Silicon Valley for developing AI models at a fraction of the cost and computing power that US tech firms like OpenAI, Google and Meta Platforms typically invest in such projects.    A red banner hung on a wall hails \"hometown pride\" Liang Wenfeng, founder and chief executive of DeepSeek, for bringing honour to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province. Photo: Weibo alt=A red banner hung on a wall hails \"hometown pride\" Liang Wenfeng, founder and chief executive of DeepSeek, for bringing honour to Mililing village in Zhanjiang, a port city in southern Guangdong province. Photo: Weibo> The heightened domestic and international attention given to DeepSeek and its founder reflects the AI community\\'s admiration for the firm\\'s low-cost development of world-class models - which either surpassed or matched the performance of rival products across a range of industry benchmark tests - in spite of tightened US restrictions on China\\'s access to advanced semiconductors and related technologies. An unidentified fellow Mililing villager was quoted by Yangcheng Evening News as saying that Liang was gifted growing up there, adding that \"he taught himself senior high-school maths when he was still a junior\".  Story Continues    During the 2002-2010 period when he studied in Zhejiang University, Liang developed an interest in applying machine-learning technology to quantitative trading. In 2015, Liang founded High-Flyer Quant, which uses deep-learning algorithms to run what has become one of the largest quantitative hedge funds in mainland China. In 2023, the company spun off DeepSeek as an independent enterprise. There are certain similarities between Liang and Jim Simons, the American quantitative hedge fund manager and mathematician, according to journalist Gregory Zuckerman, who wrote a book about the US billionaire titled The Man Who Solved the Market.    Liang apparently draws inspiration from Simons and agreed to write the preface of the book\\'s Chinese edition, Zuckerman reported in The Wall Street Journal. \"The publication of this book unravels many previously unresolved mysteries and brings us a wealth of experiences to learn from,\" Liang wrote in the preface. Liang also pointed out that whenever he encounters difficulties at work, he recalls Simons\\' words: \"There must be a way to model prices.\" This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

DeepSeek’s R1 model, which rivals top U.S. systems in performance, reportedly cost just $5.6 million to develop. The breakthrough sent shocks through global markets Monday, erasing nearly $1 trillion in U.S. and European tech stock value, including a record $589 billion drop in Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) market capitalization.    “It’s a paradigm shift,” Ali Ghodsi, CEO of Databricks Inc., said to Bloomberg. “These models that can reason are so much cheaper to produce that you will see it be democratized. You’ll see innovations from unexpected corners of the world.” Don\\'t Miss:  Nancy Pelosi Invested $5 Million In An AI Company Last Year — Here\\'s How You Can Invest In Multiple Pre-IPO AI Startups With Just $1,000  This 12,000 RPM Spinning Battery With Over $100 Million In LOIs Could Be The Missing Link For Green Energy — Here’s Why Early Investors Are Flocking To Invest Before Funding Closes   Meanwhile, OpenAI’s new o3 model, announced just before Christmas, signals a contrary trend—achieving breakthrough performance but at staggering costs. The model requires up to $3,000 to solve a single query that humans complete in seconds, using 172 times more computing power than previous approaches. “One very important thing to understand about the future: the economics of AI are about to change completely,” François Chollet, an AI researcher, said on X when o3 went public.    The model’s success came from its “test-time compute” approach, allowing it to think harder about each question. While this produced superior results, including a 91.5% score on Chollet’s challenging ARC test, it shattered previous cost assumptions about AI services. Trending: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100. OpenAI, valued at $157 billion, may charge up to $2,000 monthly for full access to o3, according to The Economist, which cited New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu. Even the company’s current “pro” version of o1 loses money on its $200 monthly subscription tier due to higher-than-expected usage. The cost structure challenges the traditional tech industry model of providing services at near-zero marginal cost. It also strengthens the position of suppliers like Nvidia and cloud providers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL)), which control the essential computing infrastructure.DeepSeek’s success suggests an alternative path. Founded by Liang Wenfeng in 2023, the company achieved its results through efficiency innovations and reinforcement learning techniques, despite limited access to advanced U.S. chips.

You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. “More investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation,” Liang told Chinese media outlet 36kr. “Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation.” The development is catching Silicon Valley’s attention. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman noted the shift, calling DeepSeek’s R1 “an impressive model” and “invigorating.” Meta established an internal team to analyze DeepSeek’s methods, according to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter.    Instead of a winner-take-all market, experts predict an oligopoly where multiple firms compete based on specialized applications. Companies like Anthropic, valued at $60 billion, and xAI at $45 billion, suggest investors see room for multiple players despite the high costs.

These 2 \\'quiet\\' trades are \\'breaking with upside\\' instead.          William Edwards   Sat, Feb 1, 2025, 1:00 PM 3 min read                       Spencer Platt/Getty Images    US stock-market outperformance is due to end, says Bank of America\\'s Michael Hartnett.  Chinese AI firm DeepSeek challenges US tech-stock valuations, he said.  Plus, a US fiscal slowdown and lower immigration rates pose risks to market performance.   The days of the US stock market\\'s outperformance on a global stage are about to end, Bank of America\\'s top global strategist Michael Hartnett says.    \"US exceptionalism now exceptionally expensive, exceptionally well-owned, outperformance to peak in \\'25,\" Hartnett said in a client note on Friday. Hartnett laid out a three-point argument for why US stocks\\' outshining of the rest of the world may be over. One was the unexpected left hook that hit the US tech sector on Monday: DeepSeek. The Chinese AI firm released its R1 chatbot to much fanfare, as it seemingly rivals ChatGPT\\'s performance with a significantly lower production price tag and more efficient energy usage. Investors were suddenly left questioning if all the money that tech firms were throwing at AI infrastructure was going to generate the kind of profits they were betting on. Hartnett thinks the answer is no. \"DeepSeek means peak in AI capex return expectations,\" he wrote. The other reasons Hartnett is skeptical that US stocks can continue to beat their global counterparts are the slowdown in government spending he expects and lower immigration levels. US fiscal spending has been well above trend over the last five years, which has helped propel the market\\'s outperformance, Hartnett argued. But since taking office on January 20, President Trump has tried to issue a government spending halt.   Bank of America   The number of immigrants entering the US at the southern border has also sharply dropped in the last few months. Hartnett highlighted that of the US population\\'s 3.3 million gain in 2024, 2.7 million (84%) were immigrants. And according to a Cato Institute analysis of Census Bureau data, 78% of job gains from 2019 to March 2024 were by immigrants. Lower immigration rates could slow job growth and hamper the economic expansion.   Bank of America   These trends don\\'t necessarily mean the broader market is set to crash, Hartnett said. Rather, the so-called Magnificent Seven is probably set to underperform, and other parts of the market could benefit. The biggest risks facing the market are inflation and where 10-year Treasury rates go, he said. Tariffs could prove trouble for inflation and rates and, in turn, stocks. On Friday, major US stock indexes dropped after the White House announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, and 10% tariffs on China. The S&P 500 fell more than 1% in the last few hours of trading, while 10-year yields climbed as much as eight basis points, from 4.5% to 4.58%.  Story Continues    2 trades outside the US Two \"quiet\" opportunities in global markets right now, meanwhile, are bank stocks in both Japan and Europe, according to Hartnett. \"Investors all-in on US exceptionalism, missing new secular bulls in cheap, unloved Japan & Europe banks,\" the notoriously short-winded Hartnett wrote. \"Note Japan banks still 74% below 1980s highs (Chart 4), EU banks 67% below 2007 highs (Chart 5), and both breaking with upside likely in our view.\" Below are the charts Hartnett is referring to.

Dan Victor, The Motley Fool   Sat, Feb 1, 2025, 4:12 AM 5 min read                   In This Article:    NVDA       DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, is sending shock waves through the U.S. tech sector by demonstrating its latest AI assistant, which achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing some of the world\\'s best chatbots. The kicker here is that DeepSeek reportedly accomplished this using significantly less computational power, relying on fewer and less advanced AI chips -- particularly Nvidia\\'s (NASDAQ: NVDA) cutting-edge GPUs, which are typically considered essential for such tasks.    This development suggests a potentially disruptive method for developing large language models (LLMs), offering a more efficient alternative to current strategies. It raises questions about future infrastructure investments and the demand for AI chips. The market\\'s reaction has been swift: As of this wriging, Nvidia\\'s stock has plunged more than 22% from its recent peak, with similar declines in other leading AI tech stocks. Let\\'s explore what DeepSeek\\'s emergence could mean for Nvidia and how it might affect investors\\' portfolios. The innovation behind DeepSeek\\'s success Artificial intelligence is not only a major theme in technology but also a national security issue, given its pivotal role in areas like data analysis, intelligence, and military applications. This has led the United States to impose bans or severe restrictions on exporting high-end technologies, such as specialized AI semiconductors, to China since 2023, aiming to slow the country\\'s technological progress and safeguard crucial supply chains. Despite these constraints, DeepSeek managed to develop AI models like DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 with cutting-edge capabilities on a reported training budget of around $6 million. Its white paper outlines an innovative approach that combines software ingenuity with new training techniques to maximize the potential of older Nvidia GPUs, surpassing their initial capabilities.    DeepSeek\\'s models have shown impressive results next to market-leading alternatives from OpenAI, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms in benchmarks for problem-solving, mathematical reasoning, coding, and general knowledge. The DeepSeek AI Assistant rapidly ascended to become the most-downloaded free application on the Apple App Store in the United States, demonstrating significant market traction and consumer acceptance. DeepSeek\\'s disruptive influence is further underscored by its open-source platform, which makes the code publicly accessible, allowing businesses and developers to customize AI models without incurring the high costs of proprietary systems. For those seeking to integrate DeepSeek\\'s most advanced models into existing tech infrastructure via an application programming interface (api), the company reportedly offers commercial pricing that is significantly lower than that of its competitors.  Story Continues      Image source: Getty Images.   Implications for Nvidia DeepSeek\\'s emergence has multiple implications for the broader tech sector. Given the initial sell-off, the market has interpreted this development as decisively negative, likely based on a concern that novel AI development methods could reduce the demand for cutting-edge, expensive hardware and cut into the competitive moat of established leaders. That being said, the impact on Nvidia may be more nuanced as it looks like the next-generation AI chips, including Nvidia\\'s Blackwell GPU architecture, are essential for pushing the boundaries of high-performance computing.    If DeepSeek managed to break AI performance benchmarks with legacy hardware, its methods toward computational efficiency implemented by other tech players could make Nvidia\\'s high-end products incrementally even more powerful. This scenario could help expand the AI market by opening up new uses that may become cost-effective while accelerating the timetable toward future breakthroughs like artificial general intelligence (AGI) applications as a demand driver for Nvidia. On the other hand, it is also clear that DeepSeek has introduced a new layer of complexity regarding Nvidia\\'s growth runway. According to Wall Street analysts monitored by Yahoo! Finance, the chipmaker is expected to reach $197 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026, which ends in January 2026, driving a 51% increase in earnings per share (EPS) to $4.45. Any sign that customers are pivoting away from large orders, even at the margin, would undermine this earnings outlook and further pressure the stock. The company\\'s upcoming fiscal 2025 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report, set to be released on Feb. 26, will provide Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and hist eam a chance to address whether DeepSeek is affecting the business and reassure shareholders.  Metric  FY 2025 Analyst Estimate  FY 2026 Analyst Estimate   Revenue  $129.2 billion  $196.5 billion   Revenue growth (YOY)  112%  52%   EPS  $2.95  $4.45   EPS growth (YOY)  127%  51%    Data source: Yahoo! Finance. FY = fiscal year. YOY = year over year. The big picture for investors DeepSeek appears to have signaled a new shift toward efficiency in AI software, highlighting the rapidly changing landscape. Recognizing near-term uncertainties with an expectation for volatility to continue, I believe investors should stay the course with Nvidia as an AI leader with a technological edge in hardware. Unless there is evidence that its financials are under pressure, a positive long-term outlook should support the stock, which remains well positioned to rebound.
